# FlappyBird
Created based on the code from Brent Aureli at https://github.com/BrentAureli/FlappyDemo, https://www.youtube.com/user/Profyx/featured. Applied some changes in structure and functionality.

Flappy Bird mobile app exercise. Just for fun and to kill my time when in public transportation. Tutorial teaches about handling game states and libGDX development framework basics.
